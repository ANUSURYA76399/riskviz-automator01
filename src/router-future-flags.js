// This file configures React Router v6 future flags to eliminate warnings
// See: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/api-development-strategy

// In React Router 6.26.x, the future flags API may have changed
// This file is imported for its side effects, but we need to handle the case where
// UNSAFE_addFutureFlag isn't available or has a different import path

// Comment out the future flags usage until we determine the correct API for this version
// If you need future flags, check the React Router documentation for your specific version

// This file has no exports - it's meant to be imported for its side effects
